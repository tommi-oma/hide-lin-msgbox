# Hide LinkedIn Message Window

I may be an unusual LinkedIn user, but it has bugged me to have the Messaging Window
always present in the Desktop browser version of LinkedIn. Googled around, but apparently it
can not be hidden. Well, it is a HTML page, so I knew that can't be the final answer, and decided
to write my very first Chrome Extension to solve my problem. Here it is.

## Usage

Install extension, currently not in Chrome store, so you need to go for it in developer style :vulcan_salute:

By default the Messaging Window is hidden, but clicking on the extension icon toggles the visibility.

## Implementation

You are here, so you have the source :man_shrugging:

If you want to know how I went on getting to this result you can take a look at my [tutorial like explanation](docs/tutorial.md) 
on the implementation.
